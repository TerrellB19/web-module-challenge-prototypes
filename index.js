/*
  TASK 1
    - Write a Person Constructor that initializes `name` and `age` from arguments.
    - All instances of Person should initialize with an empty `stomach` array.
    - Give instances of Person the ability to `.eat("someFood")`:
        + .eat() should recieve a string as a parameter and take some type of edible as an argument
        + When eating an edible, it should be pushed into the `stomach` array.
        + The `eat` method should have no effect if there are 10 items in the `stomach` array.
    - Give instances of Person the ability to `.poop()`:
        + When an instance poops, its `stomach` array should be empty.
    - Give instances of Person a method `.toString()`:
        + It should return a string with `name` and `age`. Example: "Mary, 50"
*/

function Person(name, age) {
  this.stomach = [];
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
  
}
Person.prototype.eat = function(edibleItem){
  if(this.stomach.length < 10){
    this.stomach.push(edibleItem)
  }
}
  Person.prototype.poop = function(){
     this.stomach = []; 
  }
  Person.prototype.toString = function(){
    return `${this.name}, ${this.age}`
  }



/*
  TASK 2
    - Write a Car constructor that initializes `model` and `milesPerGallon` from arguments.
    - All instances built with Car:
        + should initialize with an `tank` at 0
        + should initialize with an `odometer` at 0
    - Give cars the ability to get fueled with a `.fill(gallons)` method
      + should take 'gallons' as an parameter which will take number of gallons as an argument
      + should add the gallons to `tank`.
    - STRETCH: Give cars ability to `.drive(distance)`. The distance driven:
        + Should cause the `odometer` to go up.
        + Should cause the the `tank` to go down taking `milesPerGallon` into account.
    - STRETCH: A car which runs out of `fuel` while driving can't drive any more distance:
        + The `drive` method should return a string "I ran out of fuel at x miles!" x being `odometer`.
*/

function Car(model, milesPerGallon) {
  this.model = model;
  this.milesPerGallon = milesPerGallon
  this.tank = 0;
  this.odometer = 0;
}
Car.prototype.fill = function(gallons){
  this.tank = this.tank + gallons
}
Car.prototype.drive = function(miles){
   this.odometer.push(miles)
   const minusFuel = this.milesPerGallon / miles 
   this.tank = this.tank - minusFuel
   return
}
// ^ im not sure about this one, i didnt test it, kinda just winged it quickly ^

/*
  TASK 3
    - Write a Baby constructor subclassing Person.
    - Besides `name` and `age`, Baby takes a third argument to initialize `favoriteToy`.
    - Besides the methods on Person.prototype, babies also have the ability to `.play()`:
        + Should return a string "Playing with x", x being the favorite toy.
*/

function Baby(name, age, favoriteToy) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
  this.favoriteToy = favoriteToy
}
Baby.prototype = Object.create(Person.prototype)

Baby.prototype.play = function(){
  return `Playing with ${this.favoriteToy}`
}


/* 
  TASK 4
  In your own words explain the four principles for the "this" keyword below:
  1. new Binding,       it creats a new version of the constructor function with new objects
  2. Implicit Binding,  invokes the object to the left side of the dot
  3. Explicit Binding,  .call and .bind
  4. Window Binding,    This is the fall back binding for all functions, and is most often 
    identifiable when a function is called without using dot notation, otherwise known as free function invocation.
